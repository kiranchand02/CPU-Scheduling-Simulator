# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator

CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept in operating systems that determines how processes are executed by the CPU.
This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms to help understand their behavior, advantages, and performance in different scenarios.

# Objectives

-Simulate common CPU scheduling algorithms

-Visualize process execution order

-Analyze scheduling performance using metrics

-Strengthen understanding of operating system concepts

# Features

-Implementation of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms

-Process execution simulation

-Calculation of performance metrics

-User-friendly input and output display

-Comparative analysis of algorithms

# Scheduling Algorithms Implemented

-FCFS (First Come First Serve)

-SJF (Shortest Job First)

-SRJF (Shortest Remaining Job First)

-Priority Scheduling

-Round Robin (RR)

# Performance Metrics

Waiting Time

Turnaround Time

Completion Time

Response Time

# How It Works

User inputs process details (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.)

Selected scheduling algorithm is applied

Processes are scheduled based on algorithm rules

Execution order and metrics are calculated

Results are displayed for comparison

# Learning Outcomes

-Deep understanding of CPU scheduling concepts

-Hands-on experience with process management

-Ability to analyze algorithm efficiency

-Practical application of operating system theory
